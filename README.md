Things to do:

1. Add non-significant biomarker degs and dars to figures. Color them gray in background

2. Annotate dars with location ie promoter, intronic etc to differentiate between duplicates

3. Create cartoon showing transition from PT to PT_VCAM1

4. Aggregate hallmark apoptosis gene transcripts and correlate with biomarkers in a single column

5. Find markers comparison for PT vs PT_VCAM1 for DKD only excluding controls to confirm that changes are similar
